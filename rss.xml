            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Repost: "What is the California Roll in my Experience Design?" - Yu-kai Chou & Gamification</h1><p>I've often been asked about what I think about Nir Eyal's work. Most people don't realize we are good friends (he even gave me a front cover endorsement quote for my book), but regardless of that I think his work on the Hooked Model is extremely actionable and insightful.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3e22629baf7d10788e986627a87d9439bdf94483.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>user experience Archives - Nir and Far</h1><p>If your new product or service isn't gaining traction, ask yourself "What's my California Roll?" I'll admit, the bento box is an unlikely place to learn an important business lesson. But consider the California Roll - understanding the impact of this icon of Japanese dining can make all the difference between the success or failure of your product.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/824e40f0cde3c65d92a708496d916819e9591f01.png"></article>]]></description>
